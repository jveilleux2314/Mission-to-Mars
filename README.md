# Mission-to-Mars

Purpose:

I wanted to gather up to date information about Mars and give the site the ability to scrape the most current data at a click of a button.

Process: 

- [x] MongoDB database to store the information scraped from the website
- [x] Flask to display the data from the web scrape
- [x] HTML/CSS  
- [x] Bootstrap to make the scraped data more visually appealing 


Results:
